# How to Compile and Run
You will need to `cd` to the root directory to run `javac` or `java`
Make sure you are at `java-tutorial`
```
$ pwd
# expected to see .../java-tutorial
$ javac exercise/exercise01/IOExercise.java
# this will compile the class, and others required classes
$ java exercise.exercise01.IOExercise
```
Later on when you learn how to use VS Code or other IDE, you can run the code directly on your IDE.

Also, this is a very simple way create a Java program.

In the future, you will learn how to use Maven or Gradle to create a Java project.
